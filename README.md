Personal implementation of the MinMax algorithm for tic-tac-toe, which started as a quick experiment in recusion and ended in a dive into game theory algorithms.

This is a working directory for intellij, the compiled java executables can be run in a terminal, and are in: ~/Tic-Tac-Toe/out/production/Tic Tac Toe.

Single player is an option, although it is set to player is O only.  The real highlight of the project is number of players 0.
